<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Alethea Leora, but you can call me Thea. 
  I'm always curious about many things, especially those related to everyday life and the mysteries behind them..</p>

<p>I have a bachelor's degree in psychology because I find it fascinating to explore human personalities—especially those who are unique. 
  Besides psychology, I'm also interested in technology and am currently learning to code to build websites..</p>

<p> Classical instrumental music and old songs are my favorites. I also love the colors blue and black, as they represent calmness and depth to me. 
  I’m not a fan of crowds and prefer solitude, where I can focus and feel comfortable with my thoughts.</p>

<p>I used to enjoy reading novels, but lately, I’ve been spending more time watching interesting videos on YouTube. 
  I also love discussing random topics, from philosophy and psychology to current global events, including politics and international economics.</p>
